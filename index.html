            <p>
                Hola! My name's Andrew. I am an agile <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DevOps" target="_blank">DevOps Engineer</a> who is passionate about working with
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_as_a_service" target="_blank">Software as a Service</a> based applications,
                <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer" target="_blank">REST APIs</a>, and various web application frameworks. I am oddly
                obsessed with LAMP based systems, scaling web applications, and using <a href="http://aws.amazon.com" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services</a>.
                <br /><br />
                When I am not working on code you can typically find me tossing a frisbee, blowing off some
                steam lifting weights at the gym, or slayin' noobz on Starcraft 2.
            </p>

            <h1>Apps I've Developed</h1>
            <div class="border-purple"></div>
            <p>
                <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/airhoot/id906726361?ls=1&mt=8" target="_blank">Airhoot</a>
                <br />
				Airhoot is an anonymous, encrypted social networking platform that lets you share photos, doodles, and text without a trace!
				I developed the RESTful API service that the app uses to connect to as well as the network infrastructure. The servers are all
				running Chef and are automated for rapid scaling and deployment.
            </p>

        <div class="wrapper two">
            <h1>I Enjoy</h1>
            <div class="border-red"></div>
            <p>
                <a href="http://getchef.com/" target="_blank">Chef</a>
                <br />
                When it comes to infrastructure automation Chef is my favorite choice. The setup is
                pretty extensive especially if you go for the entire workstation / server / node setup.
                But then again what tool like this isn't a tough setup? Their Knife command is extremely
                easy to use to manage your cookbooks and nodes.
            </p>
            <p>
                <a href="http://flightphp.com/" target="_blank">Flight</a>
                <br />
                Extremely intuitive framework for developing RESTful based APIs. It's very
                light, very fast, and has very good routing techniques.
            </p>

                <a href="http://ellislab.com/codeigniter" target="_blank">Codeigniter</a>
                <br />
                When i'm not building an API centric web application I will
                use Codeigniter because of its small footprint and its ease of use and setup.

                <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/" target="_blank">Amazon Web Services</a>
                <br />
                Hands down the best cloud based service I have worked with.
                The reliability of AWS is great and they have all the tools necessary to get your web app up and running.
            </p>

                <br />
                Best SSL certificate provider I have found. They have amazing 24/7 support, great pricing, and their account
                area is very user friendly.

                <br />
                Lots of my work requires private repositories and Bitbucket is great
                because they offer unlimited private repos.

                <a href="http://aptana.com/products/studio3" target="_blank">Aptana Studio 3</a>
                <br />
                My main preference for development. It has some good syntax highlighting and
                great integration with GIT. It's also makes it very convenient for me to have an entire section
                of servers that I can quickly connect to inside the application.
